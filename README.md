##Project 3
Project 3's requirements were to have an **ocean theme**, to use **relocation features**, and use basic **math**.
As a result, I decided to create a Spongebob themed area with bubbles that follow the mouse, used relocation features, and used basic math.
I also added in Spongebobs friend Patrick by moving the mouse upward

##Project 5
Project 5's requirements were to have a **television theme** and to use **buttons**.
As a result, I made a TV with 4 different shows that can be switched with a button. You also need to turn on the TV itself.

##Project 6
Project 6's requirements were to have a **screensaver theme**, use **custom functions**, and to use **classes**.
As a result, I made a literal Windows screensaver all under different classes and using custom functions.
There is Windows 3.1, Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 10

##Project 8
Projects 8's requirements were to have a **movie poster theme**, use **fonts**, use **strings**, and to **save as a pdf**.
As a result, I made a Shrek themed poster that has the Shrek font, uses different strings, and saves as a pdf.
The Shrek poster is based of the 3d short featuring Farqaad's ghost. This takes place between Shrek and Shrek 2.

##Project 10
Project 10's requrements were to have **3d objects**, use **light**, and use **textures**.
As a result, I made a cube with a sphere inside that rotates with the mouse. Around the cube I have a box of textures and another sphere.
